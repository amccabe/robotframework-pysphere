Introducing robotframework-pysphere

The reason for this tool is to integrate the incredibly useful PySphere project
with the robotframework test framework.  In the course of working on system
management software, I found myself cleaning up after test runs where many 
systems where launched to vCenter or wanting to take snapshots in the course 
of a test for later debugging.  This was possible in several ways, but the
cleanest route seemed to be to expose a subset of the VMWare SOAP SDK to 
robotframework through keywords.  PySphere has already done a lot of this 
work and I don't want to replicate their effort, so this is just a thin layer
between the two.
